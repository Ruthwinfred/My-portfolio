My-portfolio is a site that describes me as a web developer, my career journey, what I do and my future plans in the web development journey. I did not just become a web developer by luck. I had to go to school, learn and come up with what I have right now. Thanks to God, my family, teachers and friends, you are a great part of my coding journey. By definition, a web developer is a full time learner, and so when I am not working as a web developer, I am learning something new.

To come up with this portfolio, I used the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
